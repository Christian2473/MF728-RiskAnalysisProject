5. Risk Management Strategy Performance
--------------------------------------------------
Top strategies across scenarios:
1. Convexity-enhanced strategies performed best during high volatility
2. Credit-diversified portfolios showed resilience in credit stress scenarios
3. Duration-matched strategies were effective but insufficient in extreme scenarios

6. Risk Metric Accuracy Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
For small yield shifts (<50 bps), duration-only metrics were reasonably accurate
For large shifts (>100 bps), adding convexity improved accuracy by 20-40%

7. Risk Framework Recommendations
--------------------------------------------------
1. Integrate multiple risk metrics - duration, convexity, and VaR provide complementary insights
2. Regularly stress test portfolios using both historical and hypothetical scenarios
3. Use convexity-enhanced strategies during periods of high yield volatility
4. Implement credit diversification to mitigate idiosyncratic risks
5. Adjust duration based on interest rate expectations
6. Consider barbell strategies during steepening yield curve environments
7. Bullet strategies may perform better in flattening environments
8. Monitor VaR across different confidence levels and holding periods
9. Recognize the limitations of each risk metric and use them together
10. Update risk models regularly as market conditions evolve
